      "caption": "Yesterday was a day unlike any other, a day that revealed the beauty and precision of God‚Äôs plan in the most profound way. At 4 PM, I stood at my grandmother‚Äôs grave, placing her in the earth, my heart heavy with the weight of loss. Just four hours later, at 8 PM, my sister brought a new life into this world, my niece.\n\nLife and death, grief and joy, sorrow and hope, all woven together by divine wisdom. One soul completed its journey, returning to its Creator, while another took its first breath, stepping into the unknown path ahead. Moments like these remind me that nothing in this world is random. We often see death as an ending, but in reality, it is only a transition, just as birth is the beginning of a new test, a new purpose, a new unfolding of destiny.\n\nWe say Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi rajiun, we belong to Allah, and to Him we return, but today, I felt its meaning settle deeper in my heart than ever before. My grandmother‚Äôs passing was not an end, but a return to her Creator, a homecoming to the mercy of the Most Compassionate. And in the very same day, my niece‚Äôs arrival was a reminder that while one chapter closes, another opens, each written by the Best of Planners.\n\nImam Ali AS once said, ‚ÄúThe world is a place of passage, not a place of permanence.‚Äù Yesterday, I witnessed that truth manifest before my eyes. One life fading, another emerging, both carrying the weight of divine will. It is a humbling reminder that we are all travelers on this path, moving between the temporary and the eternal, between this world and the next.\n\nAs we bid farewell to my beloved grandmother, Syeda Surriya Iftikhar binte Syed Sawar Ali Jeffery, I ask you all to recite Surah Al Fatiha for the elevation of her soul. May Allah SWT envelop her in His infinite mercy, expand and illuminate her grave, and grant her proximity to the Ahlul Bayt AS in the highest stations of Jannah. O Allah, forgive her shortcomings, grant her eternal peace, and reunite us with her under Your divine mercy.\n\nAlhamdulillah for all that He gives and all that He takes.",
